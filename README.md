# CS193P Notes and Codes

This is my notes and codes from the [Stanford's CS193P iTunes U Course (Developing iOS 9 Apps with Swift)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-9-apps-swift/id1104579961).
I will be posting my notes and course assignments here if there's anybody out there interested.

Thanks.
