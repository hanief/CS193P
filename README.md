# CS193P Notes and Codes

This is my notes and codes from the [Stanford's CS193P Spring 2016 Course (Developing iOS 9 Apps with Swift)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-9-apps-swift/id1104579961).
I will be posting my notes and course assignments here if there's anybody out there interested.

All the code samples in this repo are completely written by Paul Hegarty of Stanford University for demo during CS193P Spring 2016 Lectures. All credits goes to him. I am only rewrite it manually on my machine for practice.
